    "In its current form the K-NN model which we deployed in our previous lab to get recommended movies for a user works nicely from a Jupyter notebook. However it is hard to integrate into a business application. It requires a user embedding vector as input and returns a JSON output which is specific to our model (e.g. movie distances) and contains information which is not relevant to our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next step we will write a simple lambda function which takes a user id as input and returns a simple list of recommended movies in JSON format. The lambda function will be responsible to transform the user id into a user embedding, invoke the sagemaker endpoint and return a simplified response containing only movie ids to the user. The lambda functions will be fronted by an API Gateway, to provide the REST endpoint. See following figure a simple architecture:"
